# Example canvas game

Basic template for a 2d game in canvas.

## Set up

```
npm install
npm start
```

Then go to localhost:5050

## How to play

You can move the character in 8 directions with 'wasd'. Nothing is added to the template other than movement.

## Bugs

Sometimes images won't load the first time the game is in browser. If so, just refresh the page.
